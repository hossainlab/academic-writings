The abstract includes a concise description of the thesis â€“ the problems discussed in it and their proposed solution.  The abstract must focus on the result of the scientific investigation, rather than giving the background and methodology for the investigation.  This is why people read the abstract: to find out what you have discovered. The abstract is a self-contained text and should not contain references. If this is needed, then you can include the whole reference in the abstract.
