	I am submitting my resume for consideration for the internship program at 
	Global Public Health Research Foundation. Given the skills and experience 
	outlined in my enclosed resume, I believe I will be a worthy asset to your 
	team.
	
	In my fours years at Jagannath University, Iâ€™ve completed a great deal of 
	coursework on Epidemiology and Public Health, including Fundamentals of 
	Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, where I learned and applied skills such 
	as study design, survey design and data analysis for gaining insights from 
	data.
	
	In addition, I spent the past semester volunteering my time with a local 
	non-profit organization named Bio-Bio-1 that conducts bioinformatics 
	research and data analysis. I helped the Bio-Bio-1 team to design 
	workshops, courses and data cleanings.
	
	Finally, last year working as a management lead at the Health Data Research 
	Organization. It also helped me grow my skills in team collaboration, 
	verbal communication and project leadership.
	
	I believe I would make an excellent addition to your team. This internship 
	would help me grow my real-world experience in the global health research 
	and help me further develop and refine my research skills.
	
	I look forward to hearing from you!
