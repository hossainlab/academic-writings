This study was conducted to assess knowledge, awareness and participation of medical and non-medical students in the Malaysia National Thalassemia Prevention Programme. The design of the study was a cross-sectional study. A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed to selected students from the university. The collected data was analysed using SPSS version 20.0. Data analysis revealed a highly significant difference in total knowledge between medical students and non-medical students and the thalassemia awareness also showed significant statistical association between medical and non-medical students. In conclusion, medical students have better knowledge, awareness and screening rate of thalassemia.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the awareness of thalassemia among the students of management sciences of district Peshawar. Methodology: It was a cross sectional study in which four institutes of management science were selected randomly. Students from three disciplines (MBA, BBA and MPA) were selected using convenience sampling technique. A pre-tested questionnaire was distributed among 200 students out of which, 170 responded. Those students who claimed that they don't know about thalassemia were not tested for knowledge. Average score of each student was calculated and categorized in term of poor, fair, good, and excellent knowledge. Result: Out of the total 170 respondents, only 128 (75.2{\%}) knew something about thalassemia. Whereas 42(24.7{\%}) replied that they haven't heard about this disease. The students, which were aware about thalassemia, were further tested about their knowledge. Although majority of the participants were aware of thalassemia, their knowledge of thalassemia was poor. Majority of them had quite good knowledge about diagnosing thalassemia but most did not know the treatment and prognosis of the disease. Only 4 (3.1{\%}) students were truly aware of thalassemia. Conclusion: The awareness of thalassemia was very low among management students. Their awareness is a necessity for our country to control the increasing percentage of this disease.},

Due to remarkable success in the reduction of childhood mortality by controlling infectious diseases in developing countries, thalassemias are likely to be a major public health concern in the coming decades in South Asia. Despite the fact that Bangladesh lies in the world's thalassemia belt, the information on different aspects (epidemiology, clinical course, mortality, complications and treatment outcomes) of thalassemias is lacking. In this comprehensive review, the aim is to to depict the epidemiological aspects of thalassemias, mutation profile and current treatment and management practices in the country by sharing the experience of dealing with 1178 cases over 2009-2014 time periods in a specialized thalassemia treatment centre. We have also discussed the preventative strategies of thalassemias from the context of Bangladesh which could be effective for other developing countries.},

Place {\&} duration: The study was carried ouconducted at the Thalassemia Centre of The Children's Hospital {\&} the Institute of Child Health (CH{\&}ICH) Multan, Pakistan during 1st January 2015 and 30th July 2015. Methodology: The Data was collected from the 120 registered Thalassemia major patients' parents at the Thalassemia Centre at the CH{\&}ICH, Multan. The participants of the study were the parents of the enrolled thalassemia children in the center. The data was collected using a structured interview schedule. Collected data analysed using descriptive statistics and presented in frequency and percentage. Results: The majority of the respondents 107 (89.2{\%}) out of 110 believed that thalassemia is a blood disease, which can be identified by a blood test. Sixty (50{\%}) respondents believed that thalassemia is an inherited disorder, but 60(50{\%}) respondents either had poor or no knowledge about the disease. Alarmingly, 35(29.2{\%}) respondents were of the opinion that the patient can survive if left untreated and another 55 (45.8{\%}) respondents thought thalassemia can be treated with medicines. Conclusion: The results of the study concluded that parents knowledge of disease, treatment and prevention was inadequate. The study recommends the need of organizing seminars, public lectures for both thalassemic families and general public in order to enhance their knowledge regarding thalassemia disease and prevention.},

abstract = {Background: Thalassaemia is a potentially life-threatening yet preventable inherited hemoglobin disorder. Understanding local socio-cultural context and level of public awareness about thalassaemia is pivotal for selecting effective prevention strategies. This study attempted to assess knowledge and perceptions about thalassaemia among college students in Bangladesh. Methods: A supervised cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1578 college students using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The survey took place from 15 February 2018 to 17 March 2018 in the Jamalpur district in Bangladesh. Besides the attitude-related questions, the study asked a total of 12 knowledge-related questions, which were scored on a scale of 0-12 points. Results: Over two-thirds (67{\%}) of the college students had never heard of thalassaemia. The urban-rural dichotomy was observed among those familiar with the term; (46.4{\%} from urban vs. 25.8{\%} from rural colleges). A similar pattern was observed for knowledge score; 5.07 ± 1.87 for students from the urban colleges compared to 3.69 ± 2.23 for rural colleges. Students from the science background had the highest knowledge score (5.03 ± 1.85), while those from arts and humanities background scored lowest (3.66 ± 2.3). Nearly 40{\%} of the students were not sure or did not want to be a friend of a thalassaemia patient. Whereas 39{\%} either declined or remained hesitant about helping thalassaemia patients by donating blood. However, most of the respondents (88{\%}) showed a positive attitude towards 'premarital' screening to prevent thalassaemia. Conclusions: This study has identified critical knowledge gaps and societal misperceptions about thalassaemia. A better understanding of these aspects will be pivotal for disseminating thalassaemia related information. As the first study of this kind in Bangladesh, findings from this study has generated baseline data that would contribute to developing effective intervention strategies in Bangladesh and other countries with a comparable socio-cultural setting.},

@article{Basu2015,
abstract = {Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids, as well as cholesterol are important for neural development and maintaining brain function. However, in contrast to cholesterol, the brain is unable to synthesize the required amounts of these PUFA de novo and requires a constant supply from plasma. Suggested pools of uptake include plasma unesterified PUFA or the uptake of PUFA-containing lipoproteins via lipoprotein receptors into endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier. Our study tested whether the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) is necessary for maintaining brain PUFA and cholesterol concentrations. Moreover, since VLDLr knockout (VLDLr(-/-)) mice have been reported to have behavioural deficits, this study asked the question whether altered brain PUFA and cholesterol concentrations might be related to these deficits. VLDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice had ad libitum access to chow. At 7 weeks of age the mice were sacrificed, and the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and the remainder of the brain were isolated for total fatty acid and cholesterol analyses. There were no differences in total lipid PUFA or cholesterol concentrations in any of the four brain regions between VLDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that the VLDLr is not necessary for maintaining brain PUFA concentrations and suggest that other mechanisms to transport PUFA into the brain must exist.},

@article{Chattopadhyay2006,
abstract = {Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that has been receiving increasing attention in India. However, prevention of thalassemia in India continues to be difficult despite efforts of public health professionals and the government. Using West Bengal as a case study, this paper attempts to unravel some of the barriers to the prevention campaign and the consequent under utilization of the program. Lack of access, low awareness, low-risk perception and poverty are all important proximate constraints; however, one of the greatest barriers to the program is rooted in cultural notions of blood, marriage, identity, personhood and kinship in Bengali society. Blood is so deeply valued in the Bengali kinship system that this genetic mutation is perceived to be corrupting the blood (rakter dosh). Being a thalassemia carrier (i.e., having thalassemia minor) renders an individual unfit as a suitable marriage partner because of beliefs related to purity of blood, its association with the continuity of the lineage, and subsequent transmission of desirable traits to future generations. The risk of non-marriage affects women disproportionately, and parents are not inclined to test their daughters because of the possibility of not being able to marry them off to eligible suitors. The stigma associated with having thalassemia minor (TMI) is a deterrent to the disclosure of thalassemia status as well as to testing. Using anthropological theories and ethnographic methods, this paper focuses on the gendered process by which the diagnosis of a thalassemia carrier 'spoils' identities, thereby creating a disjuncture between the goals of the prevention program and people's need for social conformity, and ultimately between medical desirability and social desirability. The paper also suggests policies for enhancing the utilization of the program. Finally the conclusions from this study have potential applications for public health prevention programs that confront problems of stigma in program acceptability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Thalassemia can easily be prevented by awareness, education, screening, premarital genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. There are only a handful of articles on knowledge and awareness about thalassemia among general population or parents of thalassaemic children. Aims and objectives was to evaluate the level of awareness, knowledge and attitudes of medical students towards thalassemia as well as to analyse the differences if any between the first year and second year MBBS students and their correlation with various socio-demographic parameters.Methods: This was an institutional based cross sectional observational descriptive study regarding knowledge and attitude of first and second year MBBS students about thalassemia using a pre-designed, structured, self-administered questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS software version 17. Values of p{\textless}0.05 were considered significant.Results: Mean knowledge scores of second year MBBS students compared to first year MBBS were 11.73±1.78 versus 10.8±1.92, the difference being statistically significant, however, the difference between mean attitude scores was not found to be significant. There was no effect of age, gender, region or Kuppuswamy's socio-economic class on the knowledge or attitude of MBBS students towards thalassemia.Conclusions: Majority of the MBBS students had good knowledge and positive attitude towards thalassemia. To confirm the observations, large scale studies need to be conducted comprising of different study populations. Screening for thalassemia should be made mandatory, as part of medical examination, at entry to a medical college so that the medical college students are sensitized and can spread awareness among general population.},

abstract = {Introduction: Thalassemia is the most common congenital single gene disorder in Bangladesh. Considering the nature of the disease inherited from parents, thalassemia can effectively be prevented by premarital blood screening before marriage. The aim of the study was to assess the level of knowledge and awareness regarding premarital screening of $\beta$-thalassemia among undergraduate students. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted among conveniently selected 156 undergraduate students of 2 universities at Dhaka University and American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB) from January to December 2019. Data were collected by pretested semi-structured questionnaire through face to face interview. Data was analyzed using SPSS software version 23.   Results: It was found that about 49.5{\%}, 43.6{\%} and 7.1{\%} of respondents had poor, average and good knowledge about premarital screening of $\beta$-thalassemia respectively where there was statistical significance between the  level of knowledge and the parental consanguinity and the family history of thalassemia (p-value{\textless}.05). On the other hand, 66.7{\%}, 32.1{\%} and 1.3{\%} had poor, average and good awareness in this regards respectively. The level of awareness was significantly associated with the parental consanguinity, family history of thalassemia, monthly income and family type (p-value{\textless}.05).   Conclusion: This study showed knowledge and awareness levels among undergraduate students regarding premarital screening of $\beta$-thalassemia were insufficient. The thalassemia prevention can be enhanced by a well-organized educational program focusing on thalassemia and early screening in young adults.   Keywords: Thalassemia; gene disorder; premarital blood screening},
