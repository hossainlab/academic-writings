abstract = {Background: Knowledge of the factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among patients with thalassemia is essential in developing more suitable clinical, counseling, and social support programs to improve treatment outcomes of these patients. In light of the limited research in this area, this study aims to examine factors associated with HRQOL among children and adolescents with thalassemia in Thailand.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three selected hospitals in Thailand during June to November 2006. PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scale (Thai version) was used to assess HRQOL in 315 thalassemia patients between 5 and 18 years of age. Other related clinical characteristics of the patients were collected via medical record review.Results: The mean (SD) of the total summary score was 76.67 (11.40), while the means (SD) for the Physical Health Summary score and Psychosocial Health Summary score were 78.24 (14.77) and 75.54 (12.76), respectively. The school functioning subscale scored the lowest, with a mean of 67.89 (SD = 15.92). The following factors significantly affected the HRQOL of the patients: age; age at onset of anemia and age at first transfusion; pre-transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) level; receiving a blood transfusion during the previous three months; and disease severity. In addition, iron chelation therapy had a significant negative effect on HRQOL in the school functioning subscale. In contrast, serum ferritin level, frequency of blood transfusions per year, and gender were not significantly related to HRQOL among these patients. The results from multivariate analysis also confirmed these findings.Conclusions: To improve HRQOL of thalassemia patients, suitable programs aimed at providing psychosocial support and a link between the patient, school officials, the family and the physician are important, especially in terms of improving the school functioning score. The findings also confirmed the importance of maintaining a pre-transfusion Hb level of at least 9-10.5 g/dL. In addition, special care and attention should be given to patients with a severe condition, and those who are receiving subcutaneous iron chelation therapy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Thavorncharoensap et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with beta-thalassemia major ($\beta$-TM) experience physical, psychological and social problems that lead to decreased quality of life (QoL). The aim here was to measure health-related QoL and its determinants among patients with $\beta$-TM, using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study at the Hematology Research Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, in southern Iran. METHODS: One hundred and one patients with $\beta$-TM were randomly selected. After the participants' demographics and disease characteristics had been recorded, they were asked to fill out the SF-36 questionnaire. The correlations of clinical and demographic factors with the QoL score were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 44 men and 57 women of mean age 19.52 ± 4.3 years (range 12-38). On two scales, pain (P = 0.041) and emotional role (P = 0.009), the women showed significantly lower scores than the men. Lower income, poor compliance with iron-chelating therapy and presence of comorbidities were significantly correlated with lower SF-36 scores. These factors were also found to be determinants of worse SF-36 scores in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the presence of disease complications, poor compliance with ironchelating therapy and poor economic status were predictors of worse QoL among patients with $\beta$-TM. Prevention and proper management of disease-related complications, increased knowledge among patients regarding the importance of managing comorbidities and greater compliance with iron-chelating therapy, along with psychosocial and financial support, could help these patients to cope better with this chronic disease state.},

abstract = {Background. Hemoglobin E beta-thalassemia (-thalassemia/Hb E) has a variable severity, and the cost of treatment has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to analyze the societal cost of caring for children with -thalassemias in Thailand. The study was designed as a prevalence-based cost-of-illness analysis in a societal perspective. Medical records from three public hospitals of children aged 2-18 years with -thalassemia/Hb E and homozygous -thalassemia were reviewed for direct medical cost determination. For direct non-medical cost and indirect cost, a family member was interviewed. Findings. It was found that 201 patients with -thalassemia/Hb E (91{\%}) and homozygous -thalassemia (9{\%}) were recruited for this study. Ninety-two (46{\%}) were severe thalassemia and 109 (54{\%}) were mild to moderate severity. The annual average cost of treatment was US{\$}950; 59{\%} was direct medical cost, 17{\%} direct non-medical cost, and 24{\%} indirect cost. The costs were differentiated by some potential predictors. Significant predictor variables were: Hospital, health insurance scheme, blood transfusion pattern, and iron chelation drug use. Conclusions. The average annual cost per patient was calculated, and the cost model was estimated. These would be applied for national planning, economic evaluation of treatment and prevention interventions, and budget impact analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Riewpaiboon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Worldwide thalassemia poses a serious public health problem due to the high prevalence. Globally, 15 million people are suffering from clinically thalassemic disorders. Objective: To describe the lived experience of thalassaemic children in Bangladesh. Methods: This study was conducted following a descriptive qualitative research approach. Twenty thalassemic children were recruited purposively in the present study. Semi-structured individual's interview guidelines were used to collect in depth information. In addition, digital recorder was used to capture the children's voice. Data were analyzed using the process of content analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), NIANER. Results: The mean age of the thalassemic children was (16.05) SD = 1.877. Most of the children were Muslim (95.0{\%}) and they study at school (70.0{\%}). Most of their mothers were (90.0{\%}) housewife. This study revealed four major themes and eleven subthemes based on the experience of thalassemic children: 1) understanding of children meaning of thalassaemia: perception of children, unable to perform daily activities, and educational impact, 2) feeling frustrating experience and disease management: feelings about long term treatment, coping and altered body image, 3) family relationship: differences from siblings, parental attention and feeling burden, and 4) social interactions: sharing with peer, inability to social interaction. Conclusion: This study indicated that thalassaemia has affected negatively on several areas of health of these children including physical, emotional, social financial and educational areas. Reducing these problems requires comprehensive constant support and surveying health and medical status of these children to promote care and decrease the suffering of thalassaemic children. The findings of the present study are grounds for further research in a wider range to describe the different areas of the experience of thalassaemic children.},

abstract = {Thalassaemia consists one of the most common chronic and genetic hematological disorder, globally. Moreover, is a serious life-limiting and potentially life-threatening disease that causes substantial disruption in all dimensions of life. As more effective management and even cure of thalassemia become possible, attention is drawn to the evaluation of depression that frequently ollows suffering individuals. Aim: The aim of this study was to review knowledge about depression in thalassemia detailing in children, adolescents, adults. Method: The method of this study included bibliographic review of the literature, mainly in the PubMed data base, which referred to depression in thalassemic children, adolescents, adults. The search of the literature was conducted from 2001 to 2012 using the following key search terms: "depression", "thalassaemia in children-adolescents-adults". Results: Improvement of therapeutic regimen has significantly increased life expectancy of thalassemic patients but at the same time has created significant ongoing health care needs. According to the literature, depression involved in surviving thalassaemia is increasingly recognized, globally. The main factors triggering the onset of depression are personal, family, social or hereditary. Depressed thalassemic children, adolescents and adults face many difficulties in all facets of life. More in detail, depression in thalassemia is mainly related with low school or job performance, social isolation, failure of independence, maladaptive coping strategies, compromised physical ability and limited life opportunities. Provision of accurate information to thalasssemic individuals about the therapeutic regimen by expertise health professionals is a key-factor that plays a vital role on the outcome of depression. Conclusions: Regular screening for depressive symptoms is essential to identify at-risk individuals so as to provide appropriate psychological support with ultimate goal to improve both emotional and physical health.},

abstract = {Morbidity and mortality related to thalassemia have been reduced significantly with modern medical treatment, and quality of life (QOL) should now be considered an important index of effective health care. An assessment of QOL differs from other forms of medical assessment in that it focuses on the individuals' own views of their well-being and assesses other aspects of life, giving a more holistic view of well-being. There is very little published work on evaluation of QOL in thalassemia. A suitable tool should be reproducible, sensitive to the major features of the condition that affect patients' lives, and applicable in the range of different cultural, age, and social settings. Such an instrument would be valuable in evaluating new forms of treatment and in comparing health outcomes between different clinics. Two instruments have been assessed, one derived from the WHOQOL-100 questionnaire, and one designed specifically for thalassemia, which assesses psychosocial and clinical burden, as they affect adult patients, parents, and children. Further studies are required to develop and assess such tools for use in thalassemia. Another approach is to seek patients' own views of their routine treatment and the extent to which medical treatment affects QOL. Results from patient questionnaires in the United Kingdom and Cyprus are consistent in finding problems with organization of transfusions, insufficient options with chelation therapy, and poor communication. Practical measures could be taken to address these issues. {\textcopyright} 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {Thalassemia is a major genetic blood disorder that considered a public health problem in Indonesia. While significant advances have been made in the clinical management of thalassemia children over the past few decades, our knowledge of the factors affecting the quality of life of thalassemic children is limited and some previous studies have shown contradictory results. The study aimed to analyze factors impacted to the QOL of school-age thalassemic children in Indonesia. A correlational analytic with a cross-sectional approach was conducted at a district hospital in Sumedang Indonesia from May to July 2017. The PedsQL generic core scale was used to assess 55 school-age thalassemic children with thalassemia major. Data were analyzed bivariate by using Pearson and Spearman Correlation Test and multivariate analysis used multiple linear regression to determine the factor that most impacting the QOL thalassemic children. The findings showed that the average of QOL of school-age thalassemic children was 66.54+12.85. There was a significant correlation between QOL with pre-transfusion Hb level (p=0,018, $\alpha$=0,05), frequency of transfusion (p=0,000, $\alpha$=0,05), nutrient status (p=0,000, $\alpha$=0,05), family support (p=0,004, $\alpha$=0,05), friends support (p=0,000, a=0,05) and adherence to iron chelation therapy (p=0,016 and $\alpha$=0,05). Transfusion frequency is the most predicting factor that influences the QOL of school-age thalassemic children. It is suggested that effective transfusion scheduling, family and friends support, and providing adequate education for parents are essential in improving QOL thalassemic children in Indonesia.},

abstract = {Background: Health related quality of life (HRQL) has been recognised as an important paediatric outcome measurement. One of the more promising measures to emerge in recent years is the Pediatric Quality Of Life Inventory (PedsQL™), developed in the US. Advantages of the PedsQL™ include brevity, availability of age appropriate versions and parallel forms for child and parent. This study developed a UK-English version of PedsQL™ generic module and assessed its performance in a group of UK children and their parents. Methods: PedsQL™ was translated to UK-English. The psychometric properties of the UK version were then tested following administration to 1399 children and 970 of their parents. The sample included healthy children, children diagnosed with asthma, diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease and children in remission from cancer. Results: Psychometric properties were similar to those reported for the original PedsQL™. Internal reliability exceeded 0.70 for all proxy and self-report sub-scales. Discriminant validity was established for proxy and self-report with higher HRQL being reported for healthy children than those with health problems. Sex differences were noted on the emotional functioning subscale, with females reporting lower HRQL than males. Proxy and self-report correlation was higher for children with health problems than for healthy children. Conclusion: The UK-English version of PedsQL™ performed as well as the original PedsQL™ and is recommended for assessment of paediatric HRQL in the UK. {\textcopyright} 2005 Upton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Thirty-nine children (8-16 yr) with transfusion dependent thalassemia attending day care services for blood transfusion were assessed for psychological problems using the Childhood Psychopathology Measurement Schedule and QOL was assessed using the EQ-5D. Results. Forty-four percent of the children had psychological problems and 74{\%} had a poor QOL. Anxiety-related symptoms (67{\%}), emotional problems, particularly depression (62{\%}), and conduct problems (49{\%}) were the main findings. The children were most likely to report impaired QOL due to severe difficulties in pain/discomfort (64{\%}) dimension, followed by depression and mobility problems of equal severity (33{\%}). The side effects of chelation were an independent predictor of psychological problems and impaired QOL. Also psychological problems were a significant predictor of impaired QOL. Conclusion. The recognition and management of the psychological problems that accompany chronic physical illnesses including thalassemia would optimize treatment outcomes and QOL. {\textcopyright} 2007 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.},
