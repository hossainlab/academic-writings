abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant mental health threat among children in Bangladesh. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children during the lockdown in Bangladesh. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th April to 9th May 2020 among 384 parents having at least one child aged between 5–15 years using non-probability sampling. K-means clustering used to group children according to mental health score and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) performed to identify the relationship among the parental behavior and child mental health, and also these associations were assessed through chi-square test. Children were classified into four groups where 43{\%} of child had subthreshold mental disturbances (mean Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-10; 2.8), 30.5{\%} had mild (mean MDD-10; 8.9), 19.3{\%} suffered moderately (mean MDD-10; 15.9), and 7.2{\%} of child suffered from severe disturbances (mean MDD-10; 25.2). The higher percentage of mental health disturbances of children with the higher education level of parents, relative infected by COVID-19 (yes), parents still need to go the workplace (yes), and parent's abnormal behavior but lower to their counterparts. This paper demonstrates large proportions of children are suffering from mental health disturbances in Bangladesh during the period of lockdown. Implementation of psychological intervention strategies and improvement in house-hold financial conditions, literacy of parents, taking care of children, and job security may help in improving the psychological/mental status of children and the authors believe that the findings will be beneficial to accelerate the rate of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) linked to health status in Bangladesh.},

abstract = {Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and quarantine measures have raised concerns regarding their psychological effects on populations. Among the general population, university students appear to be particularly susceptible to experiencing mental health problems. Objectives: To measure the prevalence of self-reported mental health symptoms, to identify associated factors, and to assess care seeking among university students who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in France. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study collected data from April 17 to May 4, 2020, from 69054 students living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. All French universities were asked to send an email to their students asking them to complete an online questionnaire. The targeted population was approximately 1600000 students. Exposure: Living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The rates of self-reported suicidal thoughts, severe distress, stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the 20-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State subscale), and the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. Covariates were sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators (ie, loss of income or poor quality housing), health-related data, information on the social environment, and media consumption. Data pertaining to care seeking were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Results: A total of 69054 students completed the survey (response rate, 4.3{\%}). The median (interquartile range) age was 20 (18-22) years. The sample was mainly composed of women (50251 [72.8{\%}]) and first-year students (32424 [47.0{\%}]). The prevalence of suicidal thoughts, severe distress, high level of perceived stress, severe depression, and high level of anxiety were 11.4{\%} (7891 students), 22.4{\%} (15463 students), 24.7{\%} (17093 students), 16.1{\%} (11133 students), and 27.5{\%} (18970 students), respectively, with 29564 students (42.8{\%}) reporting at least 1 outcome, among whom 3675 (12.4{\%}) reported seeing a health professional. Among risk factors identified, reporting at least 1 mental health outcome was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95{\%} CI, 2.02-2.19; P {\textless}.001) or nonbinary gender (OR, 3.57; 95{\%} CI, 2.99-4.27; P {\textless}.001), precariousness (loss of income: OR, 1.28; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-1.33; P {\textless}.001; low-quality housing: OR, 2.30; 95{\%} CI, 2.06-2.57; P {\textless}.001), history of psychiatric follow-up (OR, 3.28; 95{\%} CI, 3.09-3.48; P {\textless}.001), symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (OR, 1.55; 95{\%} CI, 1.49-1.61; P {\textless}.001), social isolation (weak sense of integration: OR, 3.63; 95{\%} CI, 3.35-3.92; P {\textless}.001; low quality of social relations: OR, 2.62; 95{\%} CI, 2.49-2.75; P {\textless}.001), and low quality of the information received (OR, 1.56; 95{\%} CI, 1.49-1.64; P {\textless}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey study suggest a high prevalence of mental health issues among students who experienced quarantine, underlining the need to reinforce prevention, surveillance, and access to care..},

abstract = {Background: Investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both physical activity (PA) and mental health is important to demonstrate the need for interventions. This study examined the apparent impact of the pandemic on college students' PA, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms. Methods: From 2015 through 2020, data were collected at the beginning and end of the spring semester at a large Northeastern US university via an online survey assessing student demographics, PA, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms. Mixed ANOVA examined differences in PA and mental health changes over the spring semester between “normal” and COVID-19 circumstances. Two-way ANOVA examined the interaction between circumstance and changes in PA in relation to changes in mental health. Results: Participants (n = 1019) were predominately women and non-Hispanic white. There was a significant decline in PA and an increase in perceived stress under COVID-19, but not normal, circumstances and a significant increase in depressive symptoms under COVID-19, but not normal, circumstances among women. Conclusions: A significant decline in PA and mental health among college students occurred under COVID-19 circumstances, and PA did not appear to protect against deterioration in mental health. Proactive and innovative policies, programs, and practices to promote student health and well-being must be explored immediately.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the mental health and movement behaviours, and the associations between the changes in mental health and movement behaviours, of UK university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: 214 students enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study (mean age = 20.0 years; males = 28.0{\%}, females = 72.0{\%}) at an East Midlands UK University. Participants completed a self-report, online survey twice before (14/10/2019; T1 and 28/01/2020; T2) and twice during the UK ‘lockdown' (20/03/2020; T3 and 27/04/2020; T4). Mental wellbeing, perceived stress, physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed at each time point. Repeated measures ANCOVA was used to assess changes in variables over time, whilst Pearson's correlation analysis tested for associations. Results: During the first 5 weeks of ‘lockdown' mental wellbeing and physical activity decreased ((F (2.2, 465.0) = 6.6, P {\textless} .0010 and (F (2.7, 591.0) = 4.8, P {\textless} .010 respectively)). Meanwhile, perceived stress and time spent sedentary increased ((F (2.5, 536.2) = 94.0, P {\textless} .0050 and (F (2.7, 578.9) = 41.2, P {\textless} .0001 respectively)). A positive association was found between $\Delta$ perceived stress and $\Delta$ sedentary behaviour (r = .18, P {\textless} .010). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the mental health and movement behaviour of UK university students, though no association between these constructs was identified.},

abstract = {In Morocco, as in many countries, COVID-19 spread nationwide causing a public health emergency. Strict quarantine measures implemented as a result of the pandemic have disrupted many aspects of people's lives, triggering psychological distress. A total of 256 participants were recruited through a convenience sample. Data were collected through snowball sampling, an assessment of distress symptoms using the Brief Symptoms Inventory, and an assessment of leisure-time physical activity using the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Significant changes in paranoid ideation (z = -2.45, P = .01) and interpersonal sensitivity (z = -2.01, P = .04) dimensions were noted between those who were and those who were not authorized to leave their homes during quarantine. Similarly, for physical activity, significant changes in depression (z = -2.15, P = .03), anxiety (z = -2.13, P = .03), interpersonal sensitivity (z = -1.95, P = .05), and somatization (z = -2.11, P = .03) were reported among the insufficiently active group compared with the more physically active group. From multiple regression analysis, variables correlated with general distress were type of quarantine, gender, age, education level, chronic disease, and smoking (R2 = .80). With some variables, leisure-time physical activity domains appeared to be associated only with interpersonal sensitivity and somatization. Having to leave one's home during the outbreak was linked to distress, especially symptoms like suspiciousness, hostility, fearful thoughts of losing autonomy, and feelings of inadequacy, uneasiness, and discomfort during interpersonal interactions. Individuals who were moderately or sufficiently active physically reported less psychological distress.},

abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002–2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods: We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results: A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2{\%}) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. Conclusion: Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics.},

A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7{\%} and 57.9{\%}, respectively, and 59.7{\%} reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes. These findings warrant the consideration of easily accessible low-intensity mental health interventions during and beyond this pandemic.},

abstract = {(1) Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency that has caused worldwide concern. Vast resources have been allocated to control the pandemic and treat patients. However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students' mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality ($\beta$ = 1.37, 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness ($\beta$ = −6.57, 95{\%} CI: −12.78, −0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, p = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, p {\textless} 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, p = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions ($\beta$ = −0.12, 95{\%} CI: −0.22, −0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality. (b) A possible mitigation strategy for improving mental health includes taking suitable amounts of daily physical activity and sleeping well. (c) The COVID-19 outbreak has reduced people's aggressiveness, probably by making people realize the fragility and preciousness of life.},

abstract = {Background: As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33{\%} to 50.9{\%}), depression (14.6{\%} to 48.3{\%}), post-traumatic stress disorder (7{\%} to 53.8{\%}), psychological distress (34.43{\%} to 38{\%}), and stress (8.1{\%} to 81.9{\%}) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (≤40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Limitations: A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance. Mitigating the hazardous effects of COVID-19 on mental health is an international public health priority.},

abstract = {This study investigates students' social networks and mental health before and at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, using longitudinal data collected since 2018. We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Background: COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results: 28.5 {\%} of the respondents had stress, 33.3{\%} anxiety, 46.92{\%} depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31{\%} had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B = 3.71, 95{\%} CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B = 3.95, 95{\%} CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B = 3.82, 95{\%} CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B = 7.52, 95{\%} CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusion: This COVID-19 outbreak imposes psychological consequences on people to a great extent which requires attention from the concerned authorities to cope with this situation mentally. The perception about the outbreak can also play a big role in psychological impact.},
