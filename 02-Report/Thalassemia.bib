abstract = {Objectives: To assess the parental knowledge about thalassemia. Study design: A descriptive study. Place {\&} duration: The study was carried ouconducted at the Thalassemia Centre of The Children's Hospital {\&} the Institute of Child Health (CH{\&}ICH) Multan, Pakistan during 1st January 2015 and 30th July 2015. Methodology: The Data was collected from the 120 registered Thalassemia major patients' parents at the Thalassemia Centre at the CH{\&}ICH, Multan. The participants of the study were the parents of the enrolled thalassemia children in the center. The data was collected using a structured interview schedule. Collected data analysed using descriptive statistics and presented in frequency and percentage. Results: The majority of the respondents 107 (89.2{\%}) out of 110 believed that thalassemia is a blood disease, which can be identified by a blood test. Sixty (50{\%}) respondents believed that thalassemia is an inherited disorder, but 60(50{\%}) respondents either had poor or no knowledge about the disease. Alarmingly, 35(29.2{\%}) respondents were of the opinion that the patient can survive if left untreated and another 55 (45.8{\%}) respondents thought thalassemia can be treated with medicines. Conclusion: The results of the study concluded that parents knowledge of disease, treatment and prevention was inadequate. The study recommends the need of organizing seminars, public lectures for both thalassemic families and general public in order to enhance their knowledge regarding thalassemia disease and prevention.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the awareness of thalassemia among the students of management sciences of district Peshawar. Methodology: It was a cross sectional study in which four institutes of management science were selected randomly. Students from three disciplines (MBA, BBA and MPA) were selected using convenience sampling technique. A pre-tested questionnaire was distributed among 200 students out of which, 170 responded. Those students who claimed that they don't know about thalassemia were not tested for knowledge. Average score of each student was calculated and categorized in term of poor, fair, good, and excellent knowledge. Result: Out of the total 170 respondents, only 128 (75.2{\%}) knew something about thalassemia. Whereas 42(24.7{\%}) replied that they haven't heard about this disease. The students, which were aware about thalassemia, were further tested about their knowledge. Although majority of the participants were aware of thalassemia, their knowledge of thalassemia was poor. Majority of them had quite good knowledge about diagnosing thalassemia but most did not know the treatment and prognosis of the disease. Only 4 (3.1{\%}) students were truly aware of thalassemia. Conclusion: The awareness of thalassemia was very low among management students. Their awareness is a necessity for our country to control the increasing percentage of this disease.},

abstract = {Background. Thalassemia has a burden on the healthcare systems of many countries. About 56000 conceptions result in thalassemia, globally. Objective. To assess the epidemiological profile of thalassemia in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Methods. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine), CINAHL, and Embase. Relevant observational studies reporting the epidemiology of thalassemia among the GCC population were selected. Data on the prevalence, frequency, and complications of thalassemia were extracted. The quality of the retrieved studies was assessed according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results. Eighteen studies (14 cross-sectional studies, two retrospective observational studies, and two retrospective analysis) with a total of 3343042 participants were included in this systematic review. Of the 18 studies, 11 studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia, two in the Kingdom of Bahrain, one in Kuwait, three in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and one in Qatar. The prevalence of thalassemia among children below five years of age ranged from 0.25{\%} to 33{\%}, while it was 0.9{\%} in children above five years and from 0.035{\%} to 43.3{\%} among adult thalassemia patients. The most-reported risk factors were consanguineous marriage and high-risk marriage. There was a lack of data regarding mortality rates in thalassemia. Conclusions. Despite the premarital screening and genetic counseling (PMSGC) program for thalassemia, the incidence of high-risk couple marriages in GCC countries cannot be effectively diminished. This study suggested that the PMSGC program should adopt more attention for the high-risk areas, to enhance the level of consciousness about the hemoglobinopathy diseases and the consequences of consanguinity among the at-risk couple.},

abstract = {Thalassemia is a life-threatening blood disorder that has a high prevalence in Saudi Arabia despite the implementation of mandatory premarital testing and the availability of genetic counseling. This study aimed to assess college students' knowledge of thalassemia. A cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 920 senior students enrolled at King Abdulaziz University was conducted. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information about thalassemia and socio-demographic characteristics. Of the 920 students, 445 (48{\%}) had ever heard of thalassemia. Despite the mandatory premarital testing for thalassemia, only 50{\%} of married students stated having heard of the disease. The mean thalassemia knowledge score was 4.4 ± 2.2 out of a maximum of 12. Knowledge was significantly influenced by university faculty, gender, and education outside of Saudi Arabia. Those who had heard of thalassemia had misconceptions about the disease characteristics and pattern of inheritance such as associating thalassemia with low iron levels. A substantial proportion of the participants had a low knowledge of thalassemia. This lack of awareness requires a reassessment of the goals and success of the premarital testing program, including the genetic counseling services, and also indicates the importance of emphasizing thalassemia in school curricula and promoting and scaling up existing thalassemia campaigns in the region.},

abstract = {Introduction: Thalassemia is the most common congenital single gene disorder in Bangladesh. Considering the nature of the disease inherited from parents, thalassemia can effectively be prevented by premarital blood screening before marriage. The aim of the study was to assess the level of knowledge and awareness regarding premarital screening of $\beta$-thalassemia among undergraduate students. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted among conveniently selected 156 undergraduate students of 2 universities at Dhaka University and American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB) from January to December 2019. Data were collected by pretested semi-structured questionnaire through face to face interview. Data was analyzed using SPSS software version 23.   Results: It was found that about 49.5{\%}, 43.6{\%} and 7.1{\%} of respondents had poor, average and good knowledge about premarital screening of $\beta$-thalassemia respectively where there was statistical significance between the  level of knowledge and the parental consanguinity and the family history of thalassemia (p-value{\textless}.05). On the other hand, 66.7{\%}, 32.1{\%} and 1.3{\%} had poor, average and good awareness in this regards respectively. The level of awareness was significantly associated with the parental consanguinity, family history of thalassemia, monthly income and family type (p-value{\textless}.05).   Conclusion: This study showed knowledge and awareness levels among undergraduate students regarding premarital screening of $\beta$-thalassemia were insufficient. The thalassemia prevention can be enhanced by a well-organized educational program focusing on thalassemia and early screening in young adults.   Keywords: Thalassemia; gene disorder; premarital blood screening},

@article{Chattopadhyay2006,
abstract = {Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that has been receiving increasing attention in India. However, prevention of thalassemia in India continues to be difficult despite efforts of public health professionals and the government. Using West Bengal as a case study, this paper attempts to unravel some of the barriers to the prevention campaign and the consequent under utilization of the program. Lack of access, low awareness, low-risk perception and poverty are all important proximate constraints; however, one of the greatest barriers to the program is rooted in cultural notions of blood, marriage, identity, personhood and kinship in Bengali society. Blood is so deeply valued in the Bengali kinship system that this genetic mutation is perceived to be corrupting the blood (rakter dosh). Being a thalassemia carrier (i.e., having thalassemia minor) renders an individual unfit as a suitable marriage partner because of beliefs related to purity of blood, its association with the continuity of the lineage, and subsequent transmission of desirable traits to future generations. The risk of non-marriage affects women disproportionately, and parents are not inclined to test their daughters because of the possibility of not being able to marry them off to eligible suitors. The stigma associated with having thalassemia minor (TMI) is a deterrent to the disclosure of thalassemia status as well as to testing. Using anthropological theories and ethnographic methods, this paper focuses on the gendered process by which the diagnosis of a thalassemia carrier 'spoils' identities, thereby creating a disjuncture between the goals of the prevention program and people's need for social conformity, and ultimately between medical desirability and social desirability. The paper also suggests policies for enhancing the utilization of the program. Finally the conclusions from this study have potential applications for public health prevention programs that confront problems of stigma in program acceptability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

About one quarter of total Iranian new thal cases were born in the Sistan and Balouchistan province so the aim of this study is to assess knowledge level and attitudes towards thal in high school students in Zahedan, capital of Sistan and Balouchistan province in Iran. Study design: cross- sectional descriptive survey Methods: this study was conducted on 762 Zahedan high school boys and girls students in 2009. The structured questionnaires were completed by students which consisted of three parts, namely demographic characteristics, knowledge part by 20 multiple choice questions and attitude part by 9 questions. Results: The results indicated that only 14.7 {\%} students had good knowledge, good knowledge towards thal was 16.2{\%} in boys and 29.1{\%} in girls (P-value{\textless}0.001), positive attitude was 76.7{\%} in boys and 84.7{\%} in girls (P-value{\textless}0.029). Negative attitude in students who were born in villages and cities were 33.3{\%} and 20.7{\%} respectively (P-value=0.04). Good knowledge level in experimental field studied was between 2-4-fold more than other field students. Students in the last year high school had more knowledge and more positive attitude. Students' knowledge score had no significant relationship with father education level (P-value=0.11) but had considerable difference with mother educational level (P-value=0.03). Conclusions: It is concluded that long term and target based programs are suggested for high school students and local population of Sistan and Balouchistan where the trend of family marriages is quite high. These programs would impart valuable education and improve knowledge of people towards thal being couples in pre-marriage period and then after becoming parents thereby reducing the effects of disease.},

Aims and objectives was to evaluate the level of awareness, knowledge and attitudes of medical students towards thalassemia as well as to analyse the differences if any between the first year and second year MBBS students and their correlation with various socio-demographic parameters.Methods: This was an institutional based cross sectional observational descriptive study regarding knowledge and attitude of first and second year MBBS students about thalassemia using a pre-designed, structured, self-administered questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS software version 17. Values of p{\textless}0.05 were considered significant.Results: Mean knowledge scores of second year MBBS students compared to first year MBBS were 11.73±1.78 versus 10.8±1.92, the difference being statistically significant, however, the difference between mean attitude scores was not found to be significant. There was no effect of age, gender, region or Kuppuswamy's socio-economic class on the knowledge or attitude of MBBS students towards thalassemia.Conclusions: Majority of the MBBS students had good knowledge and positive attitude towards thalassemia. To confirm the observations, large scale studies need to be conducted comprising of different study populations. Screening for thalassemia should be made mandatory, as part of medical examination, at entry to a medical college so that the medical college students are sensitized and can spread awareness among general population.},

abstract = {Thalassaemias are a group of autosomal recessive disorder and the most common inherited disease worldwide with a wide geographical variation in incidence. Bangladesh, a developing country, having a population over 160 million. World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 3{\%} of our population carries ?- thalassaemia and 4{\%} of population carries Hb-E in Bangladesh. But recently Khan WA showed that carrier status of Hb-E is 6.1{\%} and as high as 41.7{\%} in tribal school children in Bangladesh. Since Thalassaemia is a severe and incurable disease, it is only manageable when it is prevented. The WHO has advocated and promoted the programs for thalassaemia prevention from the early 1970s. Several countries have already set up comprehensive national thalassaemia prevention programs but in our country most of the population is unware of this hereditary disease. The rapidly growing number of children diagnosed as thalassaemia in Bangladesh clearly indicate that thalassaemia will be a emerging health burden for our country. So, we need to prevent thalassaemia before its too late by comprehensive national integrated prevention programs which include public awareness and education, carrier screening, genetic counseling, premarital screening and prenatal diagnosis. Thalassaemia prevention program has become a community concern as it affects marriage practices and reproduction. So, ethical issues need to be addressed for proper implementation of this by government policy, central control and co-ordination according to the local structures, social values, religious laws and cultural tradition of our country.Bangladesh J Child Health 2016; VOL 40 (1) :31-38},

abstract = {Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids, as well as cholesterol are important for neural development and maintaining brain function. However, in contrast to cholesterol, the brain is unable to synthesize the required amounts of these PUFA de novo and requires a constant supply from plasma. Suggested pools of uptake include plasma unesterified PUFA or the uptake of PUFA-containing lipoproteins via lipoprotein receptors into endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier. Our study tested whether the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) is necessary for maintaining brain PUFA and cholesterol concentrations. Moreover, since VLDLr knockout (VLDLr(-/-)) mice have been reported to have behavioural deficits, this study asked the question whether altered brain PUFA and cholesterol concentrations might be related to these deficits. VLDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice had ad libitum access to chow. At 7 weeks of age the mice were sacrificed, and the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and the remainder of the brain were isolated for total fatty acid and cholesterol analyses. There were no differences in total lipid PUFA or cholesterol concentrations in any of the four brain regions between VLDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that the VLDLr is not necessary for maintaining brain PUFA concentrations and suggest that other mechanisms to transport PUFA into the brain must exist.},

abstract = {Thalassemia is one of the most common autosomal recessive blood disorders in the world. It shows a variety of clinical expression, starting from asymptomatic to severe blood transfusion dependence. More than 500 alleles have been characterized in or around the $\beta$-globin region. Moreover, most geographical regions have their own characteristics, frequency and availability of these alleles, predominantly circulating within the communities present in that particular region. In this study, we explored the spectrum of $\beta$-thalassemia ($\beta$-thal) alleles present in Chittagong, Southeast Bangladesh. This study comprises $\beta$-thal and Hb E (HBB: c.79 G {\textgreater} A) patients from in and around the area of Chittagong. Not only exploring the complete $\beta$-globin mutation spectrum of the area, but we also tried to look at the origin of the mutated alleles. The $\beta$-thal mutations of Bangladesh show a relatively wide spectrum of alleles, which further demonstrates the heterogeneity of the disease in this country. Although our study showed that the majority of the mutations have their origin in neighboring countries such as India, countries of Southeast Asia, Pakistan, etc., some unusual alleles do not originate in neighboring countries and put a little more diversity in the overall spectrum of $\beta$-thal-specific alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates the mutation spectrum related to $\beta$-thal in Chittagong, Southeast Bangladesh.},

abstract = {Thalassaemia is a common public health problem in Malaysia and about 4.5 to 6{\%} of the Malays and Chinese are carriers of this genetic disorder. The major forms of thalassaemia result in death in utero of affected foetuses ($\alpha$-thalassaemia) or life-long blood transfusions for survival in $\beta$-thalassaemia. This study, the first nationwide population based survey of thalassaemia in Malaysia, aimed to determine differences in public awareness, perceptions and attitudes toward thalassaemia in the multi-racial population in Malaysia. A cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interview survey of a representative sample of multi-racial Malaysians aged 18 years and above was conducted between July and December 2009. Of a total of 3723 responding households, 2846 (76.4{\%}) have heard of thalassaemia. Mean knowledge score was 11.85 (SD ± 4.03), out of a maximum of 21, with higher scores indicating better knowledge. Statistically significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) in total knowledge score by age groups, education attainment, employment status, and average household income were observed. Although the majority expressed very positive attitudes toward screening for thalassaemia, only 13.6{\%} of married participants interviewed have been screened for thalassaemia. The majority (63.4{\%}) were unsupportive of selective termination of foetuses diagnosed with thalassaemia major. Study shows that carrier and premarital screening programs for thalassaemia may be more effective and culturally acceptable in the reduction of pregnancies with thalassaemia major. The findings provide insights into culturally congruent educational interventions to reach out diverse socio-demographic and ethnic communities to increase knowledge and cultivate positive attitudes toward prevention of thalassaemia.},

abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge and attitude of Sultan Qaboos University students towards premarital screening program. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at the students' clinic from January to April 2011. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 590 unmarried Omani students of both genders. The questionnaire consisted of 3 main parts; the first part was based on socio-demographic data, the second part dealt with the students' knowledge about the premarital screening program while the third part explored their attitudes towards the screening program. Results: Most of the participants (n=469; 79{\%}) were aware about the availability of premarital screening program in Oman. The main sources of information were: school/college (n=212; 36{\%}), media (n=209; 35{\%}), family and friends (n=197; 33{\%}), and/or health services (n=181, 31{\%}). The vast majority of the participants (n=540; 92{\%}) thought it is important to carry out premarital screening and agreed to do it. Around half of the participants (n=313; 53{\%}) favored having premarital screening as an obligatory procedure before marriage and about one third (n=212; 36{\%}) favored making laws and regulation to prevent marriage in case of positive results. Conclusion: Even though the majority of the participants thought it is important to carry out premarital screening; only half favored making it obligatory before marriage and one third favored making laws and regulations to prevent marriage in case of positive results. This reflects the importance of health education as a keystone in improving knowledge and attitude towards premarital screening program. {\textcopyright} OMSB, 2012.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the knowledge among parents of thalassemia major patients about prenatal diagnosis, premarital screening for carrier detection and impact of consanguineous marriage on disease transmission. Study Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: The Thalassemia Centre, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, from July to September 2009. Methodology: One hundred and fifteen parents of $\beta$-thalassemia major patients were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire was developed and parents were interviewed to assess their knowledge about preventive measures against thalassemia major. Parents of patients with all other types of blood disorder were excluded from the study. Results: There were 74 male (64.3{\%}) and 41 female (35.7) patients with mean age of 9.5 ± 5.1 years. Eighty-eight patients (76.5{\%}) were accompanied by mothers and the rest by their fathers. Seventy-four parents (32.1{\%}) were illiterate; among the literates only 7 were highly educated (3{\%}). Ninety-four couples (81.7{\%}) had consanguineous marriage. Fiftytwo parents (44.6{\%}) knew that thalassemia is an inherited disorder. Thirty-eight (33{\%}) had heard about the test for detecting thalassemia carrier. Premarital screening and prenatal diagnosis was known to 97 (84.3{\%}) and 88 (76.5{\%}) parents respectively. Ninety-nine parents (86.1{\%}) knew about the termination of pregnancy on positive prenatal test but only 69 considered it acceptable religiously (60{\%}). Major source of information to the parents were doctors. Conclusion: Parental knowledge about thalassemia and its preventive measures was inadequate; this requires intervention in the form of public health education programs concentrating on high risk/targeted population.},

abstract = {Background: Thalassaemia is a potentially life-threatening yet preventable inherited hemoglobin disorder. Understanding local socio-cultural context and level of public awareness about thalassaemia is pivotal for selecting effective prevention strategies. This study attempted to assess knowledge and perceptions about thalassaemia among college students in Bangladesh. Methods: A supervised cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1578 college students using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The survey took place from 15 February 2018 to 17 March 2018 in the Jamalpur district in Bangladesh. Besides the attitude-related questions, the study asked a total of 12 knowledge-related questions, which were scored on a scale of 0-12 points. Results: Over two-thirds (67{\%}) of the college students had never heard of thalassaemia. The urban-rural dichotomy was observed among those familiar with the term; (46.4{\%} from urban vs. 25.8{\%} from rural colleges). A similar pattern was observed for knowledge score; 5.07 ± 1.87 for students from the urban colleges compared to 3.69 ± 2.23 for rural colleges. Students from the science background had the highest knowledge score (5.03 ± 1.85), while those from arts and humanities background scored lowest (3.66 ± 2.3). Nearly 40{\%} of the students were not sure or did not want to be a friend of a thalassaemia patient. Whereas 39{\%} either declined or remained hesitant about helping thalassaemia patients by donating blood. However, most of the respondents (88{\%}) showed a positive attitude towards 'premarital' screening to prevent thalassaemia. Conclusions: This study has identified critical knowledge gaps and societal misperceptions about thalassaemia. A better understanding of these aspects will be pivotal for disseminating thalassaemia related information. As the first study of this kind in Bangladesh, findings from this study has generated baseline data that would contribute to developing effective intervention strategies in Bangladesh and other countries with a comparable socio-cultural setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND  Thalassemia is one of the most common genetic blood disorders in Asia. Consanguineous marriages and avoiding pre-marital and antenatal screening are common in Pakistan due to psychosocial, cultural, and religious factors. Few studies have investigated the beliefs regarding thalassemia, especially in a developing country. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding thalassemia in an urban population. METHOD  A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the urban areas of Karachi, Pakistan over a period of six months during March 2016 through August 2016. Participants selected by representative sampling were interviewed face-to-face using a pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four parts. The first part inquired about general demographic variables, while the second part assessed knowledge of the participant regarding thalassemia. The third and fourth parts were concerning the beliefs and practices regarding thalassemia. Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics, v. 24.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). RESULTS  Only 53{\%} (n = 720) of the respondents had heard about thalassemia. The mean knowledge score was 5.8. The total possible score ranged between 0 - 12 with the higher scores indicating better knowledge. About three-quarters (70{\%}) of the sample did not know that an individual can be a carrier of thalassemia. Less than half (38{\%}) of the participants viewed premarital screening for thalassemia as necessary, with only 10{\%} agreeing that thalassemia carriers should not marry. There was no pre-marriage counseling done in 98{\%} of the families.  Conclusion: Our study highlights the prevalence of numerous myths and a low level of knowledge regarding thalassemia in an urban population of Pakistan.},
